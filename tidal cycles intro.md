## Tidal Cycles and Super collider

-haskell
-superdirt
-super collider
-osc messages
-powerful because it runs on the computer engine
-sends out clock info but doesn't receive it
-everytime check audiomidi set up. open supercollider.

## Tidal Cycles

we assign the name of the orbits with d1, d2 etc.

12 orbits is essentially 12 buses or channels.

*if you wanted to record your tidal cycles, follow the steps on Rachel's
repo. need an audio interface. rachel uses JACK. it's powerful for audio and
midi routing but complicated to install and use.if you outgrow Blackhole, update
to JACK.*

- you need to download OBS. order of operations on rachel's repo.
OBS also works for window capture like if you wanted to record strudel.

reference/tutorial/reading material in 08tidaycyles

what's different than strudel:

'< >' will chose in order for every cycles
'{ }%' specifies which dividier you want for euclidian rhythms
'/'

'$' is like a bus assignment. its one flow of signal where we can do things to it all on its own.

### Rachel's favorite hits of the tidal cycles language

-shift return one line
-put mouse header in the middle in and hit cntrl return for multiple lines - 1 whole orbit.

-hush : stops everything
-#silence will stop one orbit
-command / to comment out a a block of code
