-powerful because it runs on the computer engine
-sends out clock info but doesn't receive it
-everytime check audiomidi set up. open supercollider.

## Tidal Cycles

we assign the name of the orbits with d1, d2 etc.

12 orbits is essentially 12 buses or channels.

*if you wanted to record your tidal cycles, follow the steps on Rachel's
repo. need an audio interface. rachel uses JACK. it's powerful for audio and
midi routing but complicated to install and use.if you outgrow Blackhole, update
to JACK.*
