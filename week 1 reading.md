Week 1 Reading:
2 things that surprised me:

"Live coding is about making
software live" pp 2

“This way of computing . . . helps me ‘unthink’ the engineering I do as my

2 tings that I already new

Toward the end of the twentieth century, computers were becoming omnipresent
across many areas of arts practice, and communities of musicians and artists were beginning to form around specific programming languages (notable are audio programming
languages such as Max/MSP, SuperCollider, Pure Data, and CSound). Artists were beginning to use code as a creative material to express music, visuals, choreography, robotics,
video, and computer games.  pp 3

Live coding involves showing the screen or making visible the coding process as
part of a live performance. p3
